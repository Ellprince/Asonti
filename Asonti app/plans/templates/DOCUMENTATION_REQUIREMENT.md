# Documentation Research Requirement

## MANDATORY: Research Current Best Practices

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Before implementing any plan, you MUST:**

1. **Search for Latest Documentation** (Required for ALL plans)
   - Search for current year documentation (2024/2025)
   - Look for official docs from the services being used
   - Find recent best practices and patterns
   - Check for breaking changes or deprecations
   - Review security recommendations

2. **Documentation Sources to Check**
   - Official service documentation (Supabase, Vercel, etc.)
   - Recent blog posts from the service providers
   - Stack Overflow answers from current year
   - GitHub issues and discussions
   - Community best practices

3. **Key Areas to Research**
   - API changes and new features
   - Security updates and requirements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Migration strategies
   - Common pitfalls and solutions

4. **Document Findings in Plan**
   Each plan MUST include TWO sections:
   
   a) Research findings in the main body:
   ```markdown
   ## Documentation Research Findings
   - **Source:** [Official Docs/Blog/etc]
   - **Date:** When documentation was last updated
   - **Key Changes:** Any breaking changes or new patterns
   - **Best Practices:** Current recommended approaches
   ```
   
   b) Complete source list at the end:
   ```markdown
   ## Documentation Sources & References
   
   ### Official Documentation
   1. **[Feature Name]**
      URL: https://actual-url-here.com
      
   ### Community Guides
   2. **[Article Title]**
      URL: https://actual-url-here.com
      
   ### Key Takeaways from Sources
   - Point 1 (Source #)
   - Point 2 (Source #)
   
   **Last Verified:** [Current Date]
   ```

5. **Update Implementation Based on Research**
   - Adjust code patterns to match current best practices
   - Use latest API methods and features
   - Follow current security guidelines
   - Implement recommended error handling

## Example Research Queries
- "[Service] React integration 2024 2025 best practices"
- "[Feature] implementation latest documentation"
- "[Service] breaking changes migration guide"
- "[Technology] security best practices current"

## Why This Matters
- APIs change frequently
- Security vulnerabilities get patched
- New features improve performance
- Old patterns become deprecated
- Community discovers better solutions

**Never rely on outdated documentation or assumptions. Always verify with current sources.**
